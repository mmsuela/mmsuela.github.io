      <h1>Design</h1>
      <h3>Learn more details about my process</h3>
      <p> As the design chief of the Spartan Daily, I worked with writers and editors to brainstorm a vision for their story and then execute on the illustration and layout. Because the Spartan Daily is print-first, I've also brainstormed ways in using design to tailor their content across different platforms.</p>

        <div class="column"><h1>Impostor syndrome – Long-form storytelling, editing</h1>
         <p>
          I brought my own personal experience as a person of color with impostor syndrome to this story. Knowing how broad and vast the topic was, I reworked the 2,600+ word story to have a consistent theme and message for readers to take away.
         </p>
         <p> For the illustration, I went with a simple black and white design that aimed to invoke the emotions of isolation and not belonging that those with impostor syndrome endure.

      <div class="picture"><img src="images/design/australian-fires.png"  alt="australian fires"></div>
          <div class="column"><h1>Australian fires – Working on a tight deadline</h1>
           <p>When our original plan fell through, I had four hours to come up with a replacement. Despite experiencing California wildfires, most SJSU students didn't understand the impact and scope of the Australian wildfires. The design is straight to the point - it shows all of Australia, on fire. 
           </p>
           <p>Whitespace is used to ensure that no other content distracts from the illustration or headline quote.

          <div class="column"><h1>Zoom University – Personalizing the content</h1>
            <p>After the COVID-19 pandemic upended education across the country, we put out a set of tips to help students adjust. My design and illustration is built around the concept that all of the tips come together to create a cohesive environment and using an actual setting allows people to relate to it.
            </p>
            <p>Keeping in mind that most of our audience would read this on social media, from the beginning I designed it with Twitter and Instagram in mind, publishing interactive versions on those platforms.
            </p>
            <p>I readjusted the design to fit <a href="https://twitter.com/SpartanDaily/status/1253391947965755392" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B_VW5GIjdRq/" target="_blank">Instagram</a> and Instagram Stories.
