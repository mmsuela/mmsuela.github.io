  <h4>Hi, I'm Marci.</h4>
  <p>Iâ€™m currently a senior art student at San Jose State University, exercising my organizational and management skills as design chief and lifestyle editor at SJSU's newspaper The Spartan Daily. I also worked improving the social media engagement of the SJSU Library with motion design as a marketing assistant. Before I transferred to a four-year university, I was the art director and illustrator for Contra Costa College's weekly newspaper The Advocate.
    I strongly believe news design plays as much of a key role in storytelling as the actual writing does. With its power of bringing words to life and drawing readers' attention, I'm always looking to present stories in exciting new ways visually.
