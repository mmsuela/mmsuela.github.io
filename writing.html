      <p>A strong support system empowers individuals to overcome discouragement and thrive as they reach for their dreams. So when Contra Costa College health and human services department Chairperson Aminta Mickles attended graduate school, she worked hard to maintain a schedule that allowed her to pursue her career dreams.
      </p>
       <p> Her passion for earning a master’s degree in clinical psychology continuously motivated Mickles despite balancing a full-time job and taking care of her 2-year-old child.
       </p>
       <p> “I was working a full-time job in Contra Costa County’s substance abuse division and I had a child with severe asthma,” Mickles said. “But, I was doing everything I possibly could because I loved doing it.”</p>

    <p>When sociology major Caroline Watson started her academic career at Contra Costa College in 2014, she was a part-time student balancing her time between school, work and taking care of her one-year-old daughter.
    </p>
    <p> “When I started in 2014, I was a part-time student for two semesters because I was raising my daughter, who is 4 now. I wanted to do better for her, so I decided to go to school full time, which is one of the requirements for EOPS. With their support and encouragement, I was able to maintain and graduate with a 4.0 GPA,” she said.
